Python Type Conversion and Type Casting

    Before learning Type Conversion in Python, you should have knowledge about Python Data Types.

    Type Conversion:
        The process of converting the value of one data type (integer, string, float, etc.)
        to another data type is called type conversion.
        Python has two types of type conversion.

        Implicit Type Conversion
        Explicit Type Conversion

    Implicit Type Conversion:
        In Implicit type conversion, Python automatically converts one data type to another data type.
        This process doesn't need any user involvement.

    Explicit Type Conversion:
        In Explicit Type Conversion, users convert the data type of an object to required data type.
        We use the predefined functions like int(), float(), str(), etc to perform explicit type conversion.

        This type conversion is also called typecasting because the user casts (change) the data type of the objects.

        Syntax :

                (required_datatype)(expression)

    Typecasting can be done by assigning the required data type function to the expression.

    Key Points to Remember:
        Type Conversion is the conversion of object from one data type to another data type.
        Implicit Type Conversion is automatically performed by the Python interpreter.
        Python avoids the loss of data in Implicit Type Conversion.
        Explicit Type Conversion is also called Type Casting,
        the data types of object are converted using predefined function by user.
        In Type Casting loss of data may occur as we enforce the object to specific data type.
